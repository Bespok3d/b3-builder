# Lay the jinni out as a b3-builder repo-unit source dir, modelled on daemon/scripts/stage-package.sh:
# one named plugin dir under dist/package/, holding manifest.json at its root and the deployed payload
# under files/. b3-builder's packPlugin only reads files/ and doc/ out of a plugin source dir (and root
# dependency declarations); a payload staged flat at the root is packed as if it did not exist.
#
# The named dir is what makes the release happen: b3-builder's Action releases by walking the
# immediate subdirs of the source dir for a manifest.json. A package staged flat at dist/package/ packs
# and signs, then releases nothing at all and the run only fails a step later, with no release to
# attach the index atom to.
#
# Within files/, the layout mirrors the printer layout in jinni-package-spec.md: the u1 half does
# `from jinni import KlipperPrinterJinni`, so the shared runtime is staged as a files/jinni/
# sibling, and the u1 device files sit at the files/ root beside it.
#
# One package carries two source trees (klipper-jinni/jinni/ and snapmaker-u1/jinni/), so there is
# no single directory to point b3-builder at in place; this script is what composes them.
#
# tests/ and __pycache__ are never copied, from either source tree, at the copy: stronger than
# excluding them at pack time.
#
# Requires: jq.
